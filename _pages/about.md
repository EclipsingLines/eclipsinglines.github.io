I am a software developer pursuing my passion of developing useful open source software right at the intersection of art and code.

Graduated as a Mechatronics Engineer in 2013, I worked in the video game industry for over 9 years as a game developer and programming instructor.

As a developer I worked on games such as: TapCats, Adventure Capitalist and Adventure Communist, as well as over 10 unreleased internal projects for different studios. I especiallize in fast prototyping, procedural generation and AI empowered development; Very experienced with Unity 3D, I am also very familiar with open source engines like Godot and Stride.

As an instructor I have had the priviledge of teaching programming to a wide variety of students from 13 to 45 years old. I have also helped and advised on over a hundred student projects, emphazising always escalable and maintanable code.

On my free time I enjoy water color painting, playing video games and producing electronic music.
